export const COMPACT_PROMPT_OUTPUT = `Condense this conversation into a continuation prompt — imagine you're writing a briefing for a fresh instance of yourself who must seamlessly pick up where we left off, with zero access to the original conversation.

**Before writing the continuation prompt**, make sure any stable, long-term knowledge from this session has been written to AGENTS.md if it belongs there.

**What the new instance will already have:** your system prompt and AGENTS.md persistent memory are automatically re-injected after compact. Do not duplicate their contents in the continuation prompt — focus on what they don't cover: current progress, session-specific context, and in-flight work state.

Your summary should capture everything that matters and nothing that doesn't. Use whatever structure best fits the actual content — there is no fixed template. But as you write, pressure-test yourself against these questions:

- **What are we trying to do?** The user's intent, goals, and any constraints or preferences they've expressed — stated or implied.
- **What do we know now that we didn't at the start?** Key discoveries, failed approaches, edge cases encountered, decisions made and *why*.
- **Where exactly are we?** What's done, what's in progress, what's next. Be specific enough that work won't be repeated or skipped.
- **What artifacts exist?** Files read, created, or modified — with enough context about each to be actionable (not just a path list).
- **What tone/style/working relationship has been established?** If the user has shown preferences for how they like to collaborate, note them.
- **What explicit rules has the user stated?** Direct instructions about how to work, what not to do, approval requirements, or behavioral constraints the user has explicitly communicated (e.g., "don't modify code until I approve", "always run tests before committing"). Preserve these verbatim — they are binding rules, not suggestions.

**Err on the side of preserving more, not less.** The continuation prompt is the sole bridge between this conversation and the next — anything omitted is permanently lost to the new instance. Include all information that could plausibly be useful for subsequent work: partial findings, open questions, code snippets you'll need to reference, relevant file paths with context. A longer, thorough continuation prompt that preserves useful context is far better than a terse one that forces the new instance to re-discover things.

Write in natural prose. Use structure where it aids clarity, not for its own sake.`;

- **Where exactly did we stop?** Be precise: what was the last tool call, what did it return, and what was supposed to happen next? The new instance must be able to pick up mid-step without repeating or skipping anything.
- **What's done, what's in progress, what remains?** Give a clear picture of overall progress, not just the interrupted step.
- **What artifacts exist?** Files read, created, or modified — with enough context about each to be actionable.
- **What working style has the user shown?** Communication preferences, collaboration patterns, or explicit instructions about how they like to work.
